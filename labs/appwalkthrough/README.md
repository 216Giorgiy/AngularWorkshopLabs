# Angular Walk-through "Try It" Exercise - 5 Minutes

This example walks you through the fundamentals of an Angular application.

## Exercise Steps

1. Open index.html and explore the scripts included in the head section.

2. Locate the <app-component> element in the page. This acts as the 
   root component container for the entire application.

3. Open app/app.component.ts and note the following:
   * An import statement is at the top that imports Component.
   * A Component decorator is defined with several properties including the
     selector for the component.
   * A component class is defined that includes a constructor and an ngOnInit() function.

4. Click on the "Run" button on the top Plunker bar (in the upper-right corner) to run the 
   application - be amazed at the magnificence of it all. :-)
